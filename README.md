# Starburst Enterprise Presto in Google Cloud Marketplace

Starburst Enterprise Presto (SEP) is available on the Google Cloud Platform
Marketplace. It offers a simple and convenient way to get started with SEP
running on the Kubernetes.

The offering is listed in the GCP Marketplace -
Kubernetes Applications: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/starburst-public/starburst-presto

> **_NOTE:_** We do not support deployment via the CLI in the marketplace and recommend to use
the "Click To Deploy" from the UI instead. If you are looking to install using the CLI in GKE you
can use the Presto Kubernetes operator. Please follow the documentation
https://docs.starburstdata.com/latest/kubernetes/gke.html for deploying using the Presto K8s operator
from Starburst.
